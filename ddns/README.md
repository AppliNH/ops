# Dynamic DNS

When users install the software on local home hardware, etc they want to be able to access it over a Domain name.

If they use our Reverse Proxy they will not need this because we will do it all for them, but then we have to hold the connection, etc

SO this is a way for them to run without us.

STATUS

- works great with google domains and alerting to email. 


## ROADMAP

- way to hold punch the local router to port forward ?

- Add automatic Lets Encrypt.
